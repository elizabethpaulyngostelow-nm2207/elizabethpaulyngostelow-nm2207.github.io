<h1 style="color: rgb(62, 123, 133); font-family:TrebuchetMS; text-align: center">Examining Singaporean youth's attitudes and social tolerance towards serious mental illness </h1>
<br>

<!--Here will lie the text for the introduction of the data story, explaining things like the state of youth attitudes towards mental illness and how this data story is a retrospective look since its data is from 2017. How have we progressed since then? The story will invite readers to think about this.-->
<p style="color:black; font-family:TrebuchetMS">The problem is that even up till today and despite increasing awareness of mental illness and their effects on individuals, there are still prevalent negative attitudes towards those with mental illness among youth, a demographic which represents the future of Singapore. From the data visualisation, readers will understand that there are many negative associations that show the problem of the stigma attached with mental illness â€“ for example, viewing people with such illnesses as undesirable to be around.

<!--For the second and third donut charts, I plan to find a way to make them show up on clicking buttons ('See second dataset' and 'See third dataset' buttons) such that the first donut chart disappears and is replaced by the second or third donut chart.
I may thus plan to make only one of the three donut charts to be visible at one time in the final webpage.-->

<!--Third donut chart showing the sociodemographic breakdown of the sample by ethnicity-->

<!-- The three donut charts will be resized to each be bigger if I decide to make it such that only one donut chart can be seen at one time.-->

<!-- Here is the code for the 2 buttons I plan to change in my final project such that when they are clicked, they show the corresponding donut chart. (They will not be showing the time)-->

<!--Button ('See second dataset')-->
<button id="myBtn" type="button">See second dataset</button>

<!--Button ('See third dataset')-->
<button id="mySecondBtn" type="button">See third dataset</button>

  <!--Text explaining how the paper was conducted and an explanation of the data.-->
  (Draft text) The paper conducted an online survey from which 940 responses were used for analysis. Here, for introductory context, we see the sociodemographic breakdown of the survey sample from the research paper by gender, nationality and ethnicity. What do these survey respondents think about mental illness?

<h2 style="font-family:TrebuchetMS;">Section B: Survey responses</h2>

<p>
<!--More text explaining the narrative in a way that relates to the data being visualised (the vertical bar chart) -->

(Draft text) What words come to your mind when you think of the term 'mental illness?' From the survey responses, we can see how the stigma tied with mental illness is evident, with negative connotations like being uncontrolled and an outcast emanating from the common words associated with this term. But let us 
find out more in-depth about specific opinions held by these respondents. Do you agree with any of the statements in the bar chart below or know anyone who would?

<h2 style="font-family:TrebuchetMS">PCA analyses according to various loadings</h2>

<p> <!-- More text to indicate that the web page is moving from to the third section of PCA analyses.-->
  So now we that we have seen the survey results, let us move on to their analysis. What do they say about the correlations between different variables?
  </p>

<!--Tooltip in CSS that helps the reader see the more technical definition of PCA analysis when hovering over the text "What is PCA analysis?"" The definition might be changed later in order 
  to make it more understandable to a general audience.-->

    <span class="tooltiptext">PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.</span>
