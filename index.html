<h1 style="color: rgb(62, 123, 133); font-family:TrebuchetMS; text-align: center">Examining Singaporean youth's attitudes and social tolerance towards serious mental illness </h1>
<br>

<!--Text for the introduction of the data story.-->
<p style="color:black; font-family:TrebuchetMS">
  Have you ever heard an insult towards someone because of their mental illness? 
  <br><br>
  While Singapore has made strides in progress over the years regarding the availability of treatments surrounding mental illness as well as avenues of support for mentally ill individuals and their loved ones, a glaring problem still remains.
  <br><br>
  How might we visualise this? Let us take a look at the data from a research paper conducted in 2017 on Singaporean youths’ attitudes towards mental illness – Stigma among Singaporean youth: a cross-sectional study on adolescent attitudes towards serious mental illness and social tolerance in a multiethnic population.

<br><br>

<h2 style="font-family:TrebuchetMS;">Section A: Sociodemographic breakdown of sample</h2>

<p>
  <!--Text explaining how the paper was conducted and an explanation of the data.-->
  The paper conducted an online survey from which 940 responses were used for analysis. For background context, the survey respondents from the research were primarily youths with a wide variety of identities as seen from this socio-demographic breakdown by gender, nationality and ethnicity.
<br><br>
With youths representing the direction in which society is moving in, they encapsulate emerging societal values. So just what do youths think about mental illness? Let us delve into the survey responses and find out.

<h2 style="font-family:TrebuchetMS;">Section B: Survey responses</h2>

<p>
<!--More text explaining the narrative in a way that relates to the data being visualised (the vertical bar chart) -->
What words come to your mind when you think of the term 'mental illness?' From the above chart, the negative stigma associated with mental illness is evident, with negative connotations like being uncontrolled and an outcast emanating from the common words associated with this term. But let us find out more in-depth about specific opinions held by these respondents. Do you agree with any of the statements in the bar chart below or know anyone who would?
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:TrebuchetMS">Section C: PCA analyses according to various loadings</h2>

<p> <!-- More text to indicate that the web page is moving from to the third section of PCA analyses.-->
  Now that we have digested the survey results, let us move on to their analysis. What do they say about the correlations between different variables?
</p>

<!--Tooltip in CSS that helps the reader see the more technical definition of PCA analysis when hovering over the text "What is PCA analysis?""-->

The paper utilised these two scales in order to delve into factor structures under the general umbrella of youth stigma.

<!--Conclusion of data story.-->
<p>
  All in all, while a retrospective look, what has changed from 2017 till regarding our emotional responses towards mental illnesses? To progress forward, we need to think about how our attitudes impact mentally ill individuals and their loved ones. Perhaps then there will be more hope for Singapore society to be one characterised by empathy and for the youths of today to become compassionate ambassadors of tomorrow.
